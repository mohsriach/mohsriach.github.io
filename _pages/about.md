I am an incoming graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Henry Samueli School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/), University of California Los Angeles. My research interests lie in Deep Unsupervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning. I have worked on problems in Vision, Speech and Healthcare for Machine Learning. Previously, I receieved an undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [The National Institute of Engineering](https://www.nie.ac.in/).

During my undergraduate studies, I worked as an intern at [Institute for Software Integrated Systems](https://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/), Vanderbilt University and [Mercedes-Benz Research & Development India](https://mbrdi.co.in/about-us/).

If you have any opportunities/openings in ML and DL, kindly shoot me an email.

Research Interests
======
My research interests are broadly in Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. I have worked on Deep Learning applications for Vision, Speech and Autonomous Driving systems previously. Currently, specific interests include : 
1. Generative Adversarial Networks, including its optimization and stability
2. Generative models, including VAEs for Vision
3. Actor-Critic methods in RL and its connection to GANs
4. Inverse RL 
5. Imitation Learning. 

Two questions that always intrigue me are : 
a) Can machines intentionally make mistakes and incur no penalty? (When I lose a bet, I punch my fist at the wall, but ensure I don't hurt myself.) which explains the no penalty part. 
b) If the answer to a) is YES, is dumbness a subset of intelligence? 
My interests are not limited to the above and I'm open to learning/opportunities in related fields such as Computer Vision and Unsupervised Machine Learning. 

Selected Projects
======
**SinGAN paper reproduction.** 

Implemented ICCV 2019 best paper, [SinGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01164) as part of [EEML](https://www.eeml.eu/) Summer School. <br/><img src='/images/collage1.jpg'>

Investigated effects of hyperparameter tuning and change in image quality due to number of scales. Find the extended abstract [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZyK4UOg8TQQsLbBfbBLxkv45vTC60rtv/view?usp=sharing) <br/><img src='/images/collage3.jpg'>


**DCGAN for food image generation.**

Implemented Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate novel food images. Collected about 1500 high-quality images from [Zomato] and wrote a script to adjust resolution,brightness. Used TPU credits receieved from Google during Deep Learning Indaba. Presented it as part of final year project.

**Graduate Admissions Predictor**

Built Regression models (Linear, Support Vector, Decision Trees and Random Forest) to predcit graduate admission chances. Collected a dataset of 500 samples, each consisiting of test scores, GPA, quality of SOP, LOR and undergraduate university and research potential to evaluate chances of getting into a particular university. Dataset now has over 44000 downloads and is a **Gold** dataset on Kaggle. You can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions)

**Emotion Classifier using Neural Networks**

Built an emotion recognition classifier using VGG-19 with pre-trained weights using the FER2013 dataset. The trained model was used to classify real-time emotions through camera with output values displayed on the terminal. Part of course project titled 'Neural Networks'.

Blogs
======
 I also write articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mohansacharya). Please read them if you are interested in internship opportunities around the world or looking to dive into the world of Machine Learning through Summer Schools. 
 I am writing a new series on the entire graduate application process including tips and tricks to get into a top school. Stay tuned!
